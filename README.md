1. PACE Strategy Document

View Document

Description:
This project involves the development of a regression model to predict taxi fares in collaboration with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The goal is to enhance user experience by providing transparent and reliable fare estimates, fostering passenger confidence, and improving the overall trust and convenience of NYC's taxi services. The project follows the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) workflow, which includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling. Key deliverables include a regression model, data visualizations, and a cleaned dataset.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

    Structured data science workflows

    Predictive modeling using regression

    Data cleaning and visualization

    Stakeholder communication and alignment with business objectives

2. Emails to Stakeholders

View Document

Description:
This project focuses on predicting the number of visitors to the most visited national parks in the United States. The goal is to help park managers better understand visitation trends, protect natural resources, and improve visitor experiences. The project involves cleaning and analyzing historical data, building machine learning models with at least 90% accuracy, and sharing results with stakeholders. Factors such as weather, temperature, user fees, and traffic conditions are considered to improve the model's accuracy.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

    Machine learning model development

    Data analysis and cleaning

    Stakeholder communication and project management

    Strategic planning and workflow design

3. Predictive Maintenance Proposal

View Document

Description:
This project proposes a predictive maintenance solution using machine learning to predict equipment failures before they occur. The project is divided into four milestones: planning and analyzing, data processing, model construction, and execution. The final deliverables include a machine learning model, visualizations, and an executive summary shared with stakeholders. The project aims to reduce downtime, improve operational efficiency, and extend the lifespan of equipment.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

    Predictive maintenance using machine learning

    Data processing and modeling

    Stakeholder communication and feedback integration

    Project planning and milestone tracking
